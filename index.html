      <p>Heres a bit about me and the things I've been doing the last couple years.
      <br>Above is my mate, who is my dope little buddy and down to chill whenever I
      <br>have nothing going on. I'm a rising freshman going to go to wilfird laurier
      <br>university in the coming september. I'm going to study computer science and
      <br>business administration with the hopes of one day onwing owning and running
      <br>my own business. I dont think that working making money for another company
      <br>is where my desires lie.

    <h1 id="yearinReview">My Year in Review</h1>
      <p>My life has been filled with change and getting up early and getting up after opportunites.
      <br>My parents retired, so I moved to south america for almost a year. I then came to new
      <br>York to spend the year with my sister until I move into university in Canada.
